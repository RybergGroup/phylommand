Phylomand is a software package for working with phylogenies. It can be compiled
by gcc and g++ using make. Just go into the folder where the source code is and
execute

    make

on the command line. To implement multi threading give PTHREADS=YES as extra
argument. To implement optimization of likelihood score NLOPT needs to be
installed (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt) and NLOPT=YES given as
an extra argument to make. E.g.:

    make PTHREADS=YES NLOPT=YES

If you are compiling on windows using MinGW give WIN=YES as extra argument. If
you want to recompile phylommand, first remove all object files,

rm *.o

or for Windows

DEL *.o

and then compile again as above.
  
Phylomand includes:
    treebender - for manipulating and getting basic statistics from trees.
    treeator - for evaluating trees to calculate parsimony, or likelihood for
        trees, or construct trees using Neighbour joining or stepwise addition.
    contree - to compare trees and estimate decisiveness.
    pairalign - make pairwise comparisons between sequences, and can also do
        pairwise alignments.

If RUDISVG=YES is given as an extra argument ito make a rudimentary svg viewer
will also be compiled. This viewer can be used to view svg representations of
trees as outputted from treebender (except color aspects). It depends on there
being a x11 server to accept the output (standard on linux and OS X).

All programs are accept input from standard in, or a file. This means that input
can be piped from one (or another) program to the other. The program that deals
with treas accept trees in newick or nexus format; treeator also accept character
data matrices in fasta, sequential phylip, and sequential nexus format, and space
separated left triangular distance matrices; for decisiveness estimates contree
require a text file with the genes for each taxon on a separate row. 

For further instructions on possible arguments call the help function of the
respective program with the switch -h or --help, e.g.:

    treebender --help

To be able to execute the phylomand programs from any folder, move the programs
to a folder in your PATH, e.g.

sudo mv treebender /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv treeator /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv pairalign /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv contree /usr/local/bin/

,or 

su
mv treebender /usr/local/bin/
mv treeator /usr/local/bin/
mv pairalign /usr/local/bin/
mv contree /usr/local/bin/

, or put the folder with the programs into your PATH.
