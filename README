Phylomand is a software package for working with phylogenies. It can be compiled
by gcc and g++ using make. Just go into the folder where the source code is and
execute

    make

on the command line. To implement multi threading give PTHREADS=YES as extra
argument. To implement optimization of likelihood score NLOPT needs to be
installed (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt) and NLOPT=YES given as
an extra argument to make. E.g.:

    make PTHREADS=YES NLOPT=YES

If you are compiling on windows using MinGW give WIN=YES as extra argument. On
OS X you may have to make sure that the nlopt library is installed in a folder
that the linker can find, which is not always the case (this also go for x11
below).If you want to recompile phylommand, first remove all object files,


rm *.o

or for Windows

DEL *.o

and then compile again as above.
  
Phylomand includes:
    treebender - for manipulating and getting basic statistics from trees.
    treeator - for evaluating trees to calculate parsimony, or likelihood for
        trees, or construct trees using Neighbour joining or stepwise addition.
    contree - to compare trees and estimate decisiveness.
    pairalign - make pairwise comparisons between sequences, and can also do
        pairwise alignments.

If RUDISVG=YES is given as an extra argument ito make a rudimentary svg viewer
will also be compiled. This viewer can be used to view svg representations of
trees as outputted from treebender (except color aspects). It depends on there
being a x11 server to accept the output (standard on linux and OS X).

All programs are accept input from standard in, or a file. This means that input
can be piped from one (or another) program to the other. The program that deals
with treas accept trees in newick or nexus format; treeator also accept character
data matrices in fasta, sequential phylip, and sequential nexus format, and space
separated left triangular distance matrices; for decisiveness estimates contree
require a text file with the genes for each taxon on a separate row. 

For further instructions on possible arguments call the help function of the
respective program with the switch -h or --help, e.g.:

    treebender --help

To be able to execute the phylomand programs from any folder, move the programs
to a folder in your PATH, e.g.

sudo mv treebender /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv treeator /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv pairalign /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv contree /usr/local/bin/

,or 

su
mv treebender /usr/local/bin/
mv treeator /usr/local/bin/
mv pairalign /usr/local/bin/
mv contree /usr/local/bin/

, or put the folder with the programs into your PATH.

Misc.:
Phylommand work on fully resolved (bifurcating) trees and will arbitrarily
resolve any polytomies. This needs to be especially considered when defining
or queering monophyletic groups.


Treeator uses the NLOPT LN_NELDERMEAD algorithm for optimization (Nelder JA &
Mead R. 1965. A simplex method for function minimization. The Computer J. 7:308
-313). 

When colon (:) is used to separate options in extra arguments, back slash (\) can
be used as an escape character or to help denote newline (\n/\r) and tab (\t).
The special meaning of the back slash can be escaped by a back slash.

It is possible to run rudisvg on ubuntu on windows using the Xming X11 server. You
then need to set the DISPLAY parameter in your bash window by:

    export DISPLAY=:0

The MAD score calculated in pairalign is only approximate, the precision needs
to be set at compile time. To change the precision change the value of
precision at line 14 in align_group.h (default 10000 i.e. 0.001).

The calculation of decisiveness is based on randomly generated topologies. And is
thus only an estimation.
