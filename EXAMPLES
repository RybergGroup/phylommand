So to view a neighbour joining tree representation of a set of sequences it is possible to use:

  [time] mafft alignment_file.fst | pairalign -A -j -n -m | treeator -n | treebender --svg | rudisvg 

Treebender can be used to create monophyletic operational taxonomic units in a tree base on branch lengths (c.f. virtual tax sensu Öpick et al 20XX):

    treebender --cluster branch_length --cut_off 0.03 tree_file.tre 

The parsimony score of all nearest neighbour interchange trees from a topology can be given by:

    treebender --nni all tree_file.tree | treeator -f alignment.fst -p

Pairalign can be used to get which taxa can be aligned confidently according to MAD score (Smith et al. 2009, BMC Evol. Biol. 9:37):

    pairalign --alignment_groups alignment_file.fst

Contree can be used to get what clades that have more than a given support in a tree and are in conflict with clades with the given support in other trees. The output can be either text or HTML:

    contree -c 70 tree_file.trees --html

It can also be used to draw the number of times the clades of a tree occur in a set of other trees, i.e. to draw bootstrap supports:

    contree -a -d tree_file.trees tree_file.tree
