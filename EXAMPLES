Here are some examples on how phylommand can be used. The examples assumes a
basic knowledge in how to work on the command line. Many cases also assume that
you are working in a bash shell or similar.

To make and view a neighbour joining tree based on a mafft alignment:

    mafft alignment_file.fst | pairalign -A -j -n -m | treeator -n | treebender \
    --svg | rudisvg

To create monophyletic OTUs based on the branch lengths in a tree (c.f. virtual
taxa sensu Öpick et al 20XX):

    treebender --cluster branch_length --cut_off 0.03 tree_file.tre 

Get the parsimony score of all nearest neighbour interchange trees from:

    treebender --nni all tree_file.tree | treeator -f alignment.fst -p

Get alignable groups based on MAD score (Smith et al. 2009, BMC Evol. Biol.
9:37):

    pairalign --alignment_groups alignment_file.fst

Get conflict between trees that have more than given number of support in HTML
format:

    contree -c 70 tree_file.trees --html

Draw bootstrap supports on topology in tree_file.tree:

    contree -a -d tree_file.trees tree_file.tree

Get the maximum clade credibility tree in a set of trees, removing burn-in (5000
trees), and with help of awk:

    treebender --interval 5001 tree_file.trees | contree -a | treebender \
    --clade_credibility | awk -v max=0 '{if($1>max){print NR " " $1; max=$1}}'

The first value is which tree after burn-in, and the second the log sum of
support values. The last printed values should be for the maximum clade
credibility (MCC) tree. The second value is not the clade credibility since we
do not divide the support by the number of trees, and we do not compare each
tree with itself (which should add 1 to all nodes, for all trees).

If we want to change the names of many or all tips in a tree it may be convenient 
to use a file with the name changes. We can get a nice start for such a file
getting the tip names from treebender:

    treebender -t '|,\n' tree_file.tree > name_changes.txt

We can then then edit name_changes.txt, putting our new names between the '|' and
',' (you need to add | for the last name though; depending on your system and
text editor you may want to use other line break than \n), and then run:

    treebender -c file:name_changes.txt tree_file.tree

Do not forget to add new name or delete the row if you do not want to change that
name, otherwise these tip name will be deleted. If you like the output in svg
format just add --output svg. Start files for the other arguments that take
taxa as input can be gotten similarly:

    treebender -t ,\\n tree_file.tree > taxa.txt

To be able to pipe all information for the --group analyses it is possible to
give the taxonomy in the sequence names. However, pairalign does not output the
taxonomy as part of the sequence name. This may be irritating sometimes when you
make a pairwise alignment to use for a latter --group analysis. To get the
taxonomy from the first fasta file into a separate file that can be used for the
analysis you can do:

    grep '>' sequences.fst | sed 's/^>//' | awk \
    'BEGIN { FS="|" } {print $2 "|" $1}' > taxonomy_file.txt
