Put treesplitter in treebender - done
Moved superstat to contree - done
Make alignmentgroups independent of sqlite - done
Move alignmentgroups into pairalign - done
Move clustertree to treebender - done
Take care of warnings -Wall - done
Make every program pipable and also able to read from file, with file given as last argument - done
	Done:
	treeator
	pairalign - reads cin input into memory
	treebender
	contree
	#clustertree
	#alignmentgroups reads into string stream if cin and fasta
Make sure they can use -f to read files - done
Look into what file formats can be read: - done
	treebender - newick, nexus
	#clustertree - newick, nexus
	contree - newik, nexus
	treeator - fasta, phylip, nexus, newick, (for NJ only left upper triangle)
	pairalign - fasta, sqlite
	#alignmentgroups - fasta
Look at which format and how files are printed - done for now
	treebender - newick, nexus, clusters, svg, text/number 
	treeator - newick, nexus
	pairalign - fasta, plus many non standard (including left upper triangle)
	contree - newick and nexus for support, text and html for conflicts, text for decisivness
--nexus/--newick to --output nexus/newick - done
Make contree able to read treedatabase from stdin - done
Add hardcoded options for dna and protein alphabets in matrix_parser.cpp and make DNA default in treeator - done
Add function to clear internal node lables in treebender - done
Add function to set brances under a certain length to 0 in treebender - done
BUGG FIX!!! Make treebender read/print nodelabels - done
Add checks and warnings
	treeator if no alphabet - done
	treeator if distance matrix of wrong size - done
Add progress reports and quiet options - done
Go trough how extra arguments are given in treebender so it is one extra per argument - done
Make how arguments are given more uniform using argv_parser - done
Add svg viewer (latest version should be on git on NAS; download from backup?) - done
Make sure help funktions are good - improve further
Handeling of gaps in parsimony - done
Write manual - No
Check so NNI does not do the root branch twice - done
Add calculate mad for taxon set - kind of done
