Put treesplitter in treebender - done
Moved superstat to contree - done
Make alignmentgroups independent of sqlite - done
Move alignmentgroups into pairalign - done
Move clustertree to treebender - done
Take care of warnings -Wall - done
Make every program pipable and also able to read from file, with file given as last argument
	Done:
	treeator
	pairalign - reads cin input into memory
	treebender
	contree
	#clustertree
	#alignmentgroups reads into string stream if cin and fasta
Make sure they can use -f to read files - done
Look into what file formats can be read:
	treebender - newick, nexus
	#clustertree - newick, nexus
	contree - newik, nexus
	treeator - fasta, phylip, nexus, newick, (for NJ only left upper triangle)
	pairalign - fasta, sqlite
	#alignmentgroups - fasta
Look at which format and how files are printed
	treebender - newick, nexus, clusters, svg, text/number 
	treeator - newick, nexus
	pairalign - fasta, plus many non standard (including left upper triangle)
	contree - newick and nexus for support, text and html for conflicts, text for decisivness
--nexus/--newick to --output nexus/newick - done
Add checks and warnings
	treeator if no alphabet
Add prograss reports and quiet options
Add svg viewer
Make sure help funktions are good
Write manual
